Catering all the statistics lovers of the European Youth Parliament

***
Welcome! We aim to provide a GA+ platform, which can be used on any given session with any set of committees or statistics requirements. It's completely open source and uses [Python](http://python.org) in conjunction with the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Is `statistics` ready to be used?

Yes, but you can still help to improve it! Submit ideas as issues or contact us for cooperation opportunities. We also consider well coded, documented, tested and meaningful pull requests.

## What does it look like at the moment?

As soon as we reach our next major release, the platform will be available at [stats.eyp.org](http://stats.eyp.org). In the meantime, feel free to clone this repository and play around with it in it's current status.

## How To Use `statistics` during your Session

Will follow as soon as the project is available on the eyp.org server. As soon as the project is online you'll be able to add your session by visiting [stats.eyp.org/create_session](http://stats.eyp.org/create_session).


## I would like to have a new feature!

Please feel free to share your ideas! We'd love to hear them! Just add them to the issues of the project. You can also inquire about becoming a member of EYP Developers by contacting any of the projects maintainers.


## How to help make `statistics` better
You can of course send pull requests which contain features. Please make sure to contact us first to make sure that we can accept your feature into the master repository.

## I don't know how I got here, what is all of this?

If you don't know what the `EYP` (European Youth Parliament) is, read through our [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Youth_Parliament) or visit our [website](http://eypej.org).

Every time the people who are part of this organisation gather for a large event, a part of this event is called the `GA`. It stands for [General Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_assembly) and it's exactly that. During the `GA` the participants will discuss different topics in various manners. We designed `statistics` to keep track of all of this data and make it nice and easy to collect and display it.
