Catering all the statistics lovers of the European Youth Parliament

***
Welcome! We aim to provide a GA Statistics platform, which can be used on any given session with any set of committees or statistics requirements. It's completely open source and is built using [Python](http://python.org) in conjunction with the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Stuff for newcomers
#### I don't know how I got here, what is all of this?

If you don't know what the `EYP` (European Youth Parliament) is, read through our [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Youth_Parliament) or visit our [website](http://eyp.org).

Every time the people who are part of this organisation gather for a large event, a part of this event is called the `GA`. It stands for [General Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_assembly) and it's exactly that. During the `GA` the participants will discuss different topics in various manners. We designed `statistics` to keep track of all of this data and make it nice and easy to collect and display it.
