What is GA Statistics?
======================

GA Statistics is a live statistics platform for enhancing General Assemblies of Sessions of the European Youth Parliament.
The original idea was that it is interesting for session participants to be able to see in real time who is speaking in GA,
and what they are talking about. GA Statistics lets you do this in the easiest way possible.

All you and your officials team have to do is tell GA Statistics what is going on in GA (when a committee makes a point, or a vote is held etc.)
and we will give you a really nice way of visualising it.
The feedback we have received from delegates so far is that an overwhelming majority found the GA easier to follow and more engaging
when the GA Statistics platform was being used.

We are convinced that your GA can be more engaging and of higher quality with GA Statistics, but only if you use it correctly.
This is why we have put together this guide to help you achieve this goal.


Prerequisites
-------------

* A stable internet connection for the board and each person who will be submitting statistics at your GA venue
* Motivation to implement GA Statistics fully â€” this is not something you can do half-baked.
