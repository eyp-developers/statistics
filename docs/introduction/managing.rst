How to manage GA Statistics
===========================

.. note::
  This section needs further improvements and explanations, tailored to the specific roles. In the meantime, this section covers the most basic aspects.

As a GA Statistics admin, you have got a few tools available to you to help you manage your session.
There are three main tools at your disposal.
When you are on your session page and logged in as the admin of the session, there should be a dropdown menu in
the top right hand of the screen with all three tools, debate management, committee management and session settings.
There is also a management overview that contains all kind of useful information for you.

Management Overview
-------------------
The management overview gives you an overview of all links you have at your disposal. This includes all links to the relevant forms for each committee.
If you are not quite sure where to go at any point, open the management overview, it should be able to point you in the right direction.
