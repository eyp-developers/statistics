Introduction
============

You have a few options when it comes to running GA Statistics on your own computer.
But before you go ahead and do host GA Statistics on your own computer, you should ask yourself, why you would like to do that.

Why?
----

Normally, if you wanted to to use GA Statistics, you would do so by going to `our website <https://stats.eyp.org/create_session/>`_ and setting up your session there.
If that sounds like what you want to do, then great! Feel free to go ahead and start using GA Statistics on our server, that's why we put it there.

If you're still with me, then this is probably not an option. So why would you like to run GA Statistics locally?
Depending on your scenario, different approaches to hosting locally are recommended.
