Welcome to GA statistics' documentation!
========================================

Dear reader,

welcome to the documentation of GA Statistics. It is far from complete, but if that would stop us from writing anything, we wouldn't get anywhere at all.
So here we are. I hope you find some useful pages in in this documentation, which help you use and understand GA Statistics.

Yours, Tom and Oliver
