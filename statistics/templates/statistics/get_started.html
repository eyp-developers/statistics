                        GA Statistics is a <b>live statistics platform</b> for enhancing General Assemblies of Sessions of the European Youth Parliament.
                        The original idea was that it is interesting for session participants to be able to see in real time who is speaking in GA, and what they are talking about. GA Statistics lets you do this in the easiest way possible.

                        All you and your officials team have to do is tell GA Statistics what is going on in GA (when a committee makes a point, or a vote is held etc.) and we will give you a really nice way of visualising it.
                        The feedback we have received from delegates so far is that an overwhelming majority found the GA easier to follow and more engaging when the GA Statistics platform was being used.

                        GA Statistics is composed of four main modules. <b>Statistics, Point Content, Voting and Gender Statistics</b>.

                        <i>GA Statistics Modules</i>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Statistics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually in the statistics module, chairs will submit a <i>point</i> every time their committee speaks in open debate, stating the <i>subtopic</i> of the point - what it was about.
                        As the <i>points</i> accumulate, GA Statistics provides some really cool insight into what is really happening in GA.
                        Are the points evenly distributed among the committees? Which committee had the most direct responses? Which subtopics have been addressed?
                        All this data is shown live in front of the audience, ideally projected behind where the board is sitting.
                        <br>
                        <b>TLDR; Pretty Graphs</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Point Content</h3>
                    <p>
                        As opposed to statistics only stating which topics have addressed during the GA, point content states what was actually said in each point.
                        Imagine it like a tweet for each point, shortly describing what the point was about. This provides a timeline of what has happened during the debates and is very helpful
                        in understanding what has already been said in a debate. You are probably going to need a dedicated group of Journalists/Orgas/Friends to manage these point summaries,
                        as it is a very demanding job and can be difficult for chairs to do while managing their committees during GA. Trust me though, it is worth the effort.
                        <br>
                        <b>TLDR; Short summaries of each point</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Voting</h3>
                    <p>
                        The voting module does exactly what it says on the tin - it allows digital voting. Digital voting is good for a few reasons, the maths is never wrong, voting is more
                        transparent since you can see how each committee has voted, and - our personal favourite - if it is a close vote, there is an incredibly tense atmosphere as everyone watches the votes come in.
                        Again, the chairs submit this data from their phones.
                        <br>
                        <b>TLDR; Digital Voting</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Gender Statistics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gender statistics allows you to track the equality of your General Assembly. A single person tracks gender statistics during GA, and the results are shown only to the
                        session admin. Gender stats is not only useful for you to keep track of the equality of your GA, but it also helps the organisation as a whole, as it makes it possible
                        to view and analyse gender statistics for the whole EYP.

                    <h3>What should I pick?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You need to pick at least the Statistics or Point Content module — the voting and gender statistics are optional but recommended!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Different to normal Statistics, where chairs notify GA Statistics once they have made a point, telling the platform which
                        subtopics the point was on and what the point was about, Running Order Statistics gets chairs to <i>tell the board</i> what
                        their next point will be about <i>in advance</i>. The board uses this information to decide the running order of the GA. Perhaps three points
                        should be taken regarding asylum seekers before returning to the proposing committee? The running order is publicly
                        displayed on the committee page, notifying the GA which committees will be speaking next. Once the board recognises a committee,
                        the point is saved using the subtopic the chair predicted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All <i>Direct Responses</i> are automatically placed first in the queue, and the subtopic is automatically
                        assigned to that of the last recognised point.

                        If a chair at any point in time predicts the wrong subtopic - or the delegate changes his mind and speaks
                        about something different, each chair can edit the subtopics of all points they submitted on the
                        same page they use to <i>predict</i> the next subtopic.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <b>A note on Running Order Statistics</b><br>
                        We think that running order statistics are the most efficient use of GA statistics as it can significantly
                        increase the quality of GA, however, at the time of writing — Running Order Statistics are fairly new
                        and as such have not been tested as much as the other statistics types — there may be small bugs
                        particularly concerning the running order page itself. These are usually fixed by refreshing the browser window,
                        but errors can crop up. Please <i>report</i> bugs if you should find any!
