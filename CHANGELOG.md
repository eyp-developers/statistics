Since the beginning of GA Statistics, it was possible to upload images to give your session's page a personal touch and a connection to the city the session takes place in.

Recently, there has been a development towards uploading session's logos and reusing images intended to be used as Facebook header images. While of course, everyone is free to upload any image they think suits their session best, we would advise against following this trend, as those images do not play nicely with the websites layout in most cases.

Therefore, we'd like to ask you to stick to the new guidelines described below and on the *create session* page.

See for yourself. Which one would you prefer?

* Clarify which kinds of images should be uploaded for sessions
  * Images should not contain text
  * Images should feature the city and ideally a well-known landmark the city is known for
  * Images should especially *not* be the session's logo or Facebook header image
* A new option has been added to allow you to credit the photographer
* A new option has been added to allow you to specify under which license the image has published
* We strongly recommend, that you use those new options, as it will ensure you will not get into legal trouble

Oliver and Tom met in London to work on GA Statistics for a night. These are the results.

* Added a completely new front-page design
* Fixed a bug, which caused session dates to drift backwards when saving something on the settings page
* When using a page which allows the board to add statistical points on behalf of any committee, the subtopics now indicate which committee they are about
* Work has been started on introducing a very cool looking feature related to maps and the front-page â€” stay tuned to see it in action
